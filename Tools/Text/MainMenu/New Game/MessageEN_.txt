Hi Cap, welcome aboard the combat shuttle.
Now we are on the captain's bridge and all the information that we have is flowing into the control panel and is available to you, use it wisely.
To the right is an information panel, directly to the main control panel, as well as in what orbit of the planet we are.
Your assignment order does not contain information about your combat experience ...
Can you clarify it?
It was business.
Experienced.
Oh let me think...
There is one task, it will help you remember what it is like to be the commander of a combat shuttle.
May the 8-bit gods help us.
Understood, familiarize yourself with the available tasks and proceed to their implementation.
Yeah.
